                                <h3>Background of Seed of Hope Foundation (SoH-F):</h3>
                                SoH-F is an organization built on determination and commitment to provide educational supplies to rural children in the Upper West Region of Ghana and as well expose rural children to modern-day technology in learning. We believe that everyone has potential regardless of their socioeconomic living conditions. We hope that the full potential of each child is achieved in doing so we are fulfilling SDGs 4. We work hand-in-hand with the rural mother in her quest to help her child gain access to education as an approach in tackling generational poverty while living on less than USD 2 a day in the rural community. Seed of Hope Foundation strives to support rural children to realize their academic dreams by providing them with educational supplies while helping them to leverage modern technology to aid in learning.

                                <h4>Organizational Structure</h4>

                                Currently, the organization’s staff are 100% volunteers without a structured advisory board. Despite that volunteers approach, the organization's vision and mission with utmost commitment while acknowledging the fact that success in children's education should be in partnership with their parents. However, shortly, the organization shall have a well-structured advisory board with full-time workers who would fully man the affairs of the organization.

                                <h4>Background</h4>

                                Education is a human right and a crucial resource. Literacy improves health, income, and livelihood, but in 2012 the Global Partnership for Education estimated that 61 million children across the globe do not attend schools, these children find themselves disadvantaged. Without access to learning, they become trapped in the generational cycle of poverty suffered by their families and those before them. The same report noted that even when children in lesser developed countries go to school, the quality of their learning leaves them many grades behind the students of wealthier nations. Education is one of the core goals of transformative community development. A community that can learn is a community that can control its future. It can adapt, developing skills to break from the cycle of poverty. A building is not enough to draw people to learn together; people need to have the supplies to make it worth their time. Basic needs like pencils, pens, paper, and textbooks help students engage in lessons, as they gain the knowledge they can bring back to their community to improve overall welfare.

                                <p>A study by Kenyan students in 2009 indicated that uniforms aids school attendance, helping children to overcome instability and identify as students to a larger extent it reduces gender disparity. UNESCO’s 2011 Global Education Monitoring Report found a disparaging gap in the rate of primary school completion for wealthy children versus those in the poorest households; it has been established that when families are left responsible for providing school needs to their children, it discourages school attendance especially among poorer families.

                                Research by UNICEF in 2012 on education in the northern part of Ghana realized that lack of material resources is one of the main barriers to education in the north, especially in the Upper West Region where the Seed of Hope Foundation operate it is very common to meet school children who are not having any stationery to aid their learning neither to talk of uniform and sandals. Amidst the above situation, one obvious thing is the striving strength of the low-income rural women who strive to reach their goals with potency even though crude professions like cracking stones with hammers for sale, engaging in peasant farming, harvesting firewood for sale, and burning charcoal for sale. Their strength and perseverance through it, however, is uncontended and their motivating force is the future of their children's education and survival of their families, they have been restless in pursuing education for their children even with the little resources they have. Per our mission, our interest is in supporting children with the needed school supplies and as well guiding them to direct their learning using digital learning devices. Twice every year, parents’ meetings are focused on measuring our intervention’s impact and encouraging ourselves as partners in pursuing education for children.
